> This is my updated personal website. I use this to show some of my projects off, and test things out. You can see the websites & tools that I like. Sometimes I even write blogs. And, here I update my website with new features and bug fixes. Of course, try to keep it up to date with the latest tech and best practices. Here I put updated packages and tools that I use in my projects. I also try to keep my website as light as possible, so I can learn more about performance and optimization. I hope you enjoy it!

> Here is a updated version with new version of packages. I also added some new features and fixed some bugs.
