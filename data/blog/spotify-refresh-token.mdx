In this blog, I'll show you 2 approaches to generate the Spotify Refresh Token and then use that to programmatically create an access token when needed.

I needed the Spotify Refresh Token for my blog site in which I could display my [Top 10 Tracks](https://musing.vercel.app/stats) as well as display the currently playing track in the footer section.

# First Approach

<hr />

## Step 1: Generate your Spotify `client_id` and `client_secret`

- Go to [Spotify developers dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

- Then select or create your app.

- Note down your Client ID and Client Secret in a convenient location to use in Step 3.

<br />

## Step 2: Add `Redirect URIs` to your Spotify app

- Open settings for your app.

- Add `https://getyourspotifyrefreshtoken.herokuapp.com/callback` to your `Redirect URIs` as
  shown in the image.

- Click on save

<div className="grid place-items-center">
  <img
    className="inline rounded-lg"
    src="/static/images/Blog/Spotify-Callback-URL.png"
    alt="Spotify Settings"
    width="400"
    height="400"
  />
</div>

<br />

## Step 3: Get your Spotify refresh Token

- Go to [this site](https://getyourspotifyrefreshtoken.herokuapp.com/) made by [Alec Chen](https://alecchendev.medium.com/get-your-spotify-refresh-token-with-this-simple-web-app-d942dad05847)

- Add your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to the form and select the `scope` for your project. More information about the scope can be found in the [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/)

- Click on Submit to get your refresh token.

<br />
<br />

# Second Approach (Longer)

---

## Step 1: Generate your Spotify `client_id` and `client_secret`

- Follow the steps from Approach 1 till step 2 and add `<website>/callback` to your `Redirect URIs`. Eg. `http://musing.vercel.app/callback`

<br />

## Step 2: Create URI for access code

- In the URL below, replace `$CLIENT_ID`, `$SCOPE`, and `$REDIRECT_URI` with the information you noted in Step 1. **Make sure the `$REDIRECT_URI` is [URL encoded](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/).**

  ```bash
  https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=$CLIENT_ID&scope=$SCOPE&redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URI
  ```

- This is how mine looked like.

  ```bash
  https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=SCOPE&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmusing.vercel.app%2Fcallback
  ```

<br />

## Step 3: Get access code from the redirect URI

- You will be redirected to your redirect URI which in my case was set to *https://musing.vercel.app/callback*.

- In the address bar you will find a huge URL string similar to the one below. In place of `$ACCESSCODE` there will be a long string of characters. Note down that string for the next step.

  ```bash
  https://musing.vercel.app/callback?code=$ACCESSCODE
  ```
<br />

## Step 4: Get the refresh token

- Type the following CURL command in your terminal and replaces all the variables with the information you noted in Step 1 and Step 3 : `$CILENT_ID`, `$CLIENT_SECRET`, `$CODE`, and `$REDIRECT_URI`.

  ```bash
  curl -d client_id=$CLIENT_ID -d client_secret=$CLIENT_SECRET -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=$CODE -d redirect_uri=$REDIRECT_URI https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
  ```

- The resulting JSON string will look something like this. Note down the `refresh_token`. This token will last for a very long time and can be used to generate a fresh `access_token` whenever it is needed.

  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "REFRESH_TOKEN",
    "scope": "playlist-modify-private"
  }
  ```
